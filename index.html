    <h2>
      Downtown Sault Ste Marie Website Redesign
    </h2>

    <p>
      This semester, I worked on a project with three other students in the University of Michigan's School of Information. For this project, we were assigned to a client in Michigan's upper peninsula. The goal of the assignment was to help bring in more business to the downtown area. During the first semester we worked to develop the scope of the project. So far this semester, we have conducted research, analysis, and started brainstorming initial design concepts. By the end of the semester, our team will be implementing our changes to the site. Click the link below to read about the project in detail.

    <h2>
      SAP Fieldglass UX Design and Research
    </h2>



    <p>
      Last summer, I interned at SAP Fieldglass in Chicago. At SAP, I worked with the UX team helping to conduct usability testing, build wireframes, and create interactive prototypes. Specifically, working on a project to help recruiters better visualize and prioritize their upcoming tasks. With this project, we were able to eliminate one of the applications workarounds and improve their overall experience. Throughout the summer I became very familiar with popular tools such as Sketch and InVision. One of my projects involved working with the companies design system to add more page templates. This helped the rest of our team work more efficiently. I also spent much of my time learning valuable professional skills. This experience confirmed my interest in pursuing a career in UX and peaked my interest in research.

    <h2>
      Project44
    </h2>


    <p>
      At project44, a cloud-based logistics company in Chicago, I worked with the UX team to redesign a key landing page for the company website. Our goal was to show potential customers how project44's technology can help their company. By increasing the number of free demo request forms that are filled out, we could improve the chances of converting leads into paying customers. I was tasked with researching form page design trends and conceptualizing the design for the landing page. I collaborated with the head of the UX team and the VP of marketing, frequently presenting wireframes and mockups, to receive feedback and update concepts. The main requirement for this project was to maintain brand consistency. I worked with a style guide to ensure the brand values were reflected properly.
