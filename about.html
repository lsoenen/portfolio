    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <main>

    <h2> Background </h2>

    <p>
      My name is Luke Soenen and I was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Michigan School of Information, with a concentration in User Experience (UX) Design. After college I would like to move back to the Greater Chicago Area and work work at a company where I will be able apply the skills that I am learning in my classes. The UMSI program offers a great mix of classes which teach students both technical and client facing skills. This unique combination allows students to develop a well rounded skill set.
    </p>

    <h2> Major </h2>

    <p>
      My passion for art sparked my interest in UX and motivates me to learn as much as possible about the field. I worked at SAP Fieldglass last summer designing wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and building clickable prototypes to help create a more user friendly product. I also assisted the user research process with usability testing and result synthesis. During the usability testing we observed participants while they tried to accomplish a list of tasks. In the analysis, we grouped these observations into different categories which we used to adjust the design.

    <h2> Other </h2>

    <p>
      For fun, I work on a site with other U of M students called The Lake Games. Our team is working to bring the joy of water sports competition into a continuous online experience. Participants can upload videos of themselves completing tricks to different categories. These categories include wakeboarding, water skiing, barefooting, and surfing. Judges score these videos based on their difficulty and they are ranked from 1st to 3rd. We plan to launch the new site this June.
