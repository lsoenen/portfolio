    <h1>Downtown Sault Ste. Marie Website Redesign</h1>


    <main>

    <h2> Background </h2>

    <p>
      Worked on a project with the Sault Ste. Marie Downtown Development Authority (DDA) to redesign their website. The goal of the project was to bring more business into the downtown area.
    </p>

    <h3> Research Phase </h3>

    <p>
      Our team conducted research for this project using surveys, interviews, and usability tests. We collected data from hundreds of business owners and residents in Sault Ste. Marie. In creating tasks for the usability test, we focused on tasks that were related to the goal of driving more business into the downtown area. For example, "Find the operating hours for Island Books & Crafts." This helped us identify areas that users struggle with when trying to get the information they need. The survey questions focused on participants attitudes toward the current site. These answers helped us identify specific areas to focus on in our redesign.
    </p>

    <h3> Analysis </h3>

    <p>
      Our team used affinity diagraming to identify specific areas that we should focus on. Our main finding was that the directory page is where most visitors find information related to the stores. This page includes the location, phone number, and social media pages. Because of this, our team decided to focus on redesigning this page. In doing so, people would be more likely to visit the stores and increasing business.
